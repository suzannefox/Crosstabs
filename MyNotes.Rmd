## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document.

## Installs

Install package if it's not already there, devtools in this case

```{r CheckInstall}
# If devtools isn't there then install it
if ("devtools" %in% rownames(installed.packages()) == FALSE) {
  install.packages("devtools")
} else {
  print("devtools already installed")
}
```

## Versions and libraries

Check which version of R we're using

```{r version, echo=FALSE}
version

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
